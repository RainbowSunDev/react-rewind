# Rewind: A Time Travel Debugger for React *useReducer*

[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/reactrewind/react-rewind/pulls) [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
![Release Beta](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-beta-blue.svg)<br/><br/>
 Designed to help engineers fix bugs faster by recording and replaying through different states of their applications. Debug your app more easily by “rewinding” your session instead of having to wait to reproduce the issue once you find the problem. <br/>



- Press record and start interacting with your application.
- Each dispatched action will be stored as a unique event in time.
- Rewind through your recorded actions with the back button or by dragging the slider.
- Analyze the state, the effects and the action object of every dispatched event.
- Press play and watch your app change!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You must use an unminified version of React. Also, your application must be using the hook `useReducer` for actions to be recorded.

### Installing
You can install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-rewind/gaombjmfkfdcfaeehpflnkkfdbpmjohl?hl=en).

To install locally, setup instructions are as follows:

1. `git clone --single-branch --branch beta-release https://github.com/reactrewind/react-rewind.git`
2. Visit the URL `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click Load Unpacked button and select the folder `react-rewind/chrome`
4. On your application page, open the Chrome Developer (Ctrl + Shift + J / Mac: Cmd + Option + I) tools and select `React Rewind` from the tool bar
5. Click Record and begin interacting with your application


As you interact with your application, actions will populate the events panel. Click on these actions to view more details about them, such as the action object that was dispatched, the effects or state difference, and the whole state of the application after the dispatch. The time slider panel allows you to rewind, fast forward, and play through all recorded actions.
